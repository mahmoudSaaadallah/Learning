- Before starting with the BOM check the window Object [[Window Object]].

- In JavaScript, **BOM** stands for **Browser Object Model**.
- It is a collection of objects that provide an interface to interact with the web browser itself, rather than the content of the web page (which is handled by the DOM). 
- The BOM allows JavaScript to "talk" to the browser **window**, **navigate** to different URLs, manage browser **history**, interact with the user's **screen**, and more.
- Unlike the **DOM** (<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Document Object Model</span>), there is no official standard for the BOM, though modern browsers have largely converged on common implementations.
